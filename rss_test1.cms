<![CDATA[ ‘America first’ policy may revive trade tussle over tariffs ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ Trump’s “America First” policy could reignite a trade war between Washington and Beijing. Some experts, however, see a window of opportunity for India to ramp up its supplies to the US. This is because Trump has vowed to punish China with much higher tariffs than other nations to restore bilateral trade balance. Also, given its more domesticallyoriented economy, India would be less vulnerable to higher tariffs than China, Barclays said in a report on Wednesday. “We estimate Trump’s tariff proposals would subtract 2% from China’s GDP – and greater pain on the more open economies in the rest of the region.” ]]>
